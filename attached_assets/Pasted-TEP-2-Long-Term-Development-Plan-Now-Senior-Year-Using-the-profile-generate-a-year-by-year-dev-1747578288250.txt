TEP 2: Long-Term Development Plan (Now → Senior Year)
Using the profile, generate a year-by-year development strategy that includes:

Combine Metric Progressions (target improvements per year)

Body Development (height, weight, body fat %, position benchmarks)

Academic Goals (GPA, SAT/ACT, NCAA eligibility)

Nutrition Roadmap (macros, calories, body comp changes per year)

Recruiting Milestones (film, camps, contact strategy)

Build yearly goals aligned to athlete’s desired level of play and provide benchmarks needed to reach that level. Update this roadmap dynamically as progress data is submitted.

📅 STEP 3: Current Year Plan → Quarterly Breakdown
Break the current year’s goals into seasonal goals and quarterly milestones for:

A. Training & Lifting Program (Daily Level):

Pre-season (May–July)

In-season (Aug–Oct/Nov)

Off-season (Nov/Dec–Apr)

For each season, list daily exercises with:

Sets, reps, % of 1-rep max

Rest intervals

Movement purpose (tie each to combine metric: e.g., vertical = power cleans, box jumps)

Recovery and mobility

Include a structured weekly lifting/training schedule.

B. Nutrition Program:

Seasonal caloric and macronutrient targets

Meal ideas and weekly templates (pre-, in-, off-season)

Sample grocery lists for families

Supplement recommendations (if needed)

Macro/carb-cycling adjustments based on training intensity

Ensure the plan adapts to growth, effort, and recovery needs. Nutrition and training should be synchronized.

C. Recruiting Tasks by Month:

Film creation/updates

Social media and outreach calendar

DM/email templates by school/level

Camp and combine participation tracking

Monthly check-ins with actionable goals

🔁 STEP 4: 12-Week Progress Monitoring
Every 12 weeks, prompt the athlete to submit updated:

Height, weight, BF%

Lifting maxes, combine metrics

Recruiting activities

Highlight film progress

Academic GPA

Compare current performance vs. milestone. Generate a report with:

What they achieved

Where they fell short

Updated recommendations for goals

🔮 STEP 5: Annual Review & College Football Projection
At year-end, generate a 3-tier projection based on actual progress and time left:

High: Athlete maximizes growth, combine scores, effort

Medium: Meets consistent, realistic goals with moderate growth

Low: Makes below-average progress

Compare this to original goals. Ask if the athlete wants to maintain, lower, or stretch their current targets based on projections. Update training, academic, and recruiting goals accordingly.
